# Access Timecard System
The company uses Access to manage their time keeping and logging.  Since Access always seems to crash at inopportune times, I made a system with the existing Access system that simplifies the process.  
It is primarily run by using VBA and SQL in the background.  VBA/SQL code is located here.

Quick breakdown of what is included:
* Timekeeping Form
  * The main form used for data entry, which is visible to all employees


* Custom Query Form
  * A form that lets you fill in parameters for a search, such as name of the employee, date worked, work code, and more.

When it comes time for a refresh of the database, that will be included as well.
