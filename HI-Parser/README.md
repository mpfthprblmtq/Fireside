# HI-Parser
When we do Due Diligence, which is evaluating a property for purchase, we go in and inspect every detail with each unit and building in the property.  We use an app called Happy Inspector from HappyCo, which exports a big nasty spreadsheet.

This software parses that big nasty spreadsheet and puts the data into a premade template that is easier on the eyes.
